## weechat-irccloud-safelist

Some networks decide to ban Mibbit or IRCCLOUD, especially the latter since  
it also acts as a bouncer and out of a limited number of IP adresses a number   
of users can connect and abuse.

If you happen to have IRCOP privileges on a server then you can use this  
script and implement a sort of banlist where all other IRCOPs can ban and  
safelist users connecting from IRCCLOUD.

This was tested on UnrealIRCd but can be modified to work with other servers  
and services.
